    <h1>Song Scoop</h1>
    <h5>Tired of having to fight for the aux cord just to pick one song? Or worse have to find out whose phone the music is playing on because you're tired of listening to Beyonce for 3 hour straight? Us too</h5>
    <h5>Song Scoop is an App meant to change that. Whoever has reign of the aux chooses to host a session. Once that session is linked to their Spotify, they will be given a 4-digit code to share around. Guests choose to join a session, type in the code, and viola! You can add songs to the playlist.</h5>
    <h5>Once songs have been added to the playlist, any guest in the session can choose to like or downvote songs, and they will be moved up or down the playlist based on their ranking. This ensures that the majority ensures the best music is played, and so someone can't sneak up and start playing WAP on repeat.</h5>
    <h5> With Love, Only Grant</h5>
